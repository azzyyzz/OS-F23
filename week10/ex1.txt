Question 1:
Yes, the monitor.c program reported an event for myfile11.txt.
The log entry "File /home/muhibullo/Desktop/os23/week10/fol1/myfile11.txt was modified."
indicates that the program detected a modification in myfile11.txt.

Question 2:
No, the monitor.c program did not report an event for myfile13.txt.
Symbolic links only reference the target file, and changes to the target file are not
considered events for the symbolic link itself.
