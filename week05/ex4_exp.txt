As the results show, the same logic from ex3 is applied here. We can clearly see that increasing the number of threads does not necessarily decrease total execution time. Maybe it could depend on the system, or on the number of cores of a CPU. Moreover, the total execution time is higher than ex3 because here we have more waiting. The threads are waiting for the other threads to increment, or check primality, thus increasing the total time.
